## Oct 31 2015
* Fixed error with Client.js getUser() where it would crash when no `users` brain file existed.

## Oct 29 2015
* Updated pattern for `Templater` class to use '{{VAR}}' instead of '${VAR}'.
  * **Required update**
  * If you are using the `Templater` class, make sure your template strings use the '{{VAR}}' pattern.
* Removed the `upcoming` playlist command
* Updated `skip` playlist command to be random
* Fixed auto ban command
* Changed how user messages are stored.
  * **Required update**
  * If you depended on userMessages, you should clear your userMessages brain file because the structure has changed.
* Assets now load custom assets, and then core assets.
* Rearranged setup folder so it makes more sense.
* Updated the Loader class to read settings files to determine which commands and plugins it should load.
  * **Required update**
  * By default, all core commands are enabled.
  * By default, all plugins are disabled.
  * You must add a `coreCommands` and `plugins` setting to your `setup/custom/settings.json` file if you want to enable or disable commands and plugins.
* Fixed bug with `greeting` command where an existing user with a status that did not have a matching greeting, was not greeted.
  * **Required update**
  * If you had any custom greetings, you will need to update to the new greeting structure. See `setup/core/settings.json` for an example.
